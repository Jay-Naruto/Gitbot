# GitBot (AI-powered Git Assistant)

GitBot is an AI-powered Git assistant that simplifies Git operations by allowing users to interact with their repositories using natural language commands. It leverages OpenAI's GPT model to translate user inputs into corresponding Git commands and executes them step by step, making version control more accessible for everyone, even beginners.
